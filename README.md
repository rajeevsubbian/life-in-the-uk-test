### History facts ###

* By the middle of the 15th century the last Welsh rebellions had been defeated. English laws and the English language were introduced.
* Between 1680 and 1720 many refugees called **Huguenots** came from France. They were Protestants and had been persecuted for their religion. Many were educated and skilled and worked as scientists, in banking, or in weaving or other crafts.
* In the 1830s and 1840s, a group called the Chartists campaigned for reform. They wanted six changes:
    * for every man to have the vote
    * elections every year
    * for all regions to be equal in the electoral system
    * secret ballots
    * for any man to be able to stand as an MP
    * for MPs to be paid
* During the Middle Ages, the English kings also fought a number of wars abroad. Many knights took part in the Crusades, in which European Christians fought for control of the Holy Land. English kings also fought a long war with France, called the Hundred Years War (even though it actually lasted 116 years).

## Government and politics facts ##


* When you arrive at the polling station, the staff will ask for your name and address. In Northern Ireland you will also have to show photographic identification. You will then get your ballot paper, which you take to a polling booth to fill in privately
* The Prime Minister appoints about **20** senior MPs to become ministers in charge of departments:  
    * **Chancellor of the Exchequer** – responsible for the economy
    * **Home Secretary** – responsible for crime, policing and immigration
    * **Foreign Secretary** – responsible for managing relationships with foreign countries
    * other ministers (called ‘**Secretaries of State**’) responsible for subjects such as education, health and defence.
* The House of Lords can suggest amendments or propose new laws, which are then discussed by MPs. It checks laws that have been passed by the House of Commons to ensure they are fit for purpose. It also holds the government to account to make sure that it is working in the best interests of the people.
* Since 1958, the Prime Minister has had the power to nominate peers just for their own lifetime. These are called life peers. They have usually had an important career in politics, business, law or another profession. Life peers are appointed by the monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister.
* Since 1999, hereditary peers have lost the automatic right to attend the House of Lords. The Reform Act of 1832 had greatly increased the number of people with the right to vote. The Act also abolished the old pocket and rotten boroughs and more parliamentary seats were given to the towns and cities.
* MPs have a number of different responsibilities. They:
    * represent everyone in their constituency
    * help to create new laws
    * scrutinise and comment on what the government is doing
    * debate important national issues
* As well as getting the right to vote, people on the electoral register are randomly selected to serve on a jury. Anyone who is on the electoral register and is aged **18 to 70** can be asked to do this.
* In November 2012, the public elected Police and Crime Commissioners (PCCs) in England and Wales.
